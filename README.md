lab 02 about me guessing game
(copy of about-me lab from code 201)
**this was made to deal with the green contribution graph on my github profile. it was out of whack from making heaps of commits in this lab back in 201, i'm making a copy of it in order to delete the original and bring the squares back in order.**

### Tues June 2
*Today I started this project with very simple html and css, and JavaScript with 5 yes/no  if/else statements. Spent heaps of time on the yes/no statements so will add to the html and css later.*

### Weds June 3
*Today we're adding to our projects. I'm going to add a Top Ten list, add an additional question to the guessing game for numeric input and 4 opportunities to guess correctly, and create a question that has many possiblities so I can store data in an array and use a loop. I will also be adding an alert at the end so the user knows how many questions they answered correctly of the 7. I'll also work on adding more css elements to my page.*

### Thu June 4
*Robert Rizo: Today me and Tia created a button to trigger the JS fucntions, and wrapped the questions on a function each to call individually. Explored and cleaned lint errors due to js files not knowing about the html on its own*

### Thu Aug 13
*Created this clone of the original repo, deleted original.*
